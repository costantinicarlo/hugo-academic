I am a **medical entomologist** working at the French [**Research Institute for Sustainable Development**](http://en.ird.fr) (IRD) in the _Infectious Diseases and Vectors—Ecology, Genetics, Evolution, and Control_ mixed research unit ([UMR MIVEGEC](http://mivegec.ird.fr/en/)). The unit federates researchers from the [**University of Montpellier**](http://www.umontpellier.fr/en/), the [**National Centre for Scientific Research**](http://www.cnrs.fr/en/) (CNRS, research unit #5290), and IRD (research unit #224). I integrate within MIVEGEC the _Evolution of Vectorial Systems_ team ([ESV](http://mivegec.ird.fr/fr/equipes/esv)), whose main interest is the study of the biology and control of major arthropod disease vectors, including mosquitoes, triatomine bugs, bedbugs, and sandflies.

I got a BSc (_laurea cum laudae_) in Natural Sciences at the **University of Rome** “[_Sapienza_](http://en.uniroma1.it)”, and a PhD at the Department of Biology (now Life Sciences) of [Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine](http://www.imperial.ac.uk), **University of London**, while working as a Research Assistant at the [Silwood Park](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/silwood-park/) campus. Along these years  my academic mentors have been [Mario Coluzzi](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-13-10) and [John Brady](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1046/j.0307-6962.2001.00263.x/full).

My research interests revolve around the evolutionary and behavioural ecology of **mosquitoes**, with particular reference to anopheline **malaria vectors**. I have worked for many years in the field in tropical Africa focussing on the killer mosquitoes _Anopheles gambiae_, _Anopheles funestus_, and their close allies. The ultimate objective of my research is to develop more efficient strategies to control the diseases these vectors transmit to humans.

I am an enthusiastic  [**useR!**](http://www.r-project.org) who strives to extract as much statistically-sound information as possible from hard-earned datasets, while espousing the philosophy that scientific research should be reproducible. There is an amusing link between my two major scientific interests: mosquitoes and biostatistics; you can read about it [here](http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700).

I am also a keen **photographer** and spend some of my free time **birdwatching**. I am a member of the [African Bird Club](http://www.africanbirdclub.org) and occasionally write about birds or contribute to [bird image online databases](http://www.africanbirdclub.org/afbid/home/photographer/588).
